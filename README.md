# Train Status

The best website to check the status of your train (and bus).

If you'd like to try a hosted version of the API, you can find the documentation [here](https://trainstat.us/api/docs). You can also host your own version using the prebuilt container images linked to this repository.

A realtime bus map is available at <a href="https://map.trainstat.us" target="_blank">map.trainstat.us</a>.
